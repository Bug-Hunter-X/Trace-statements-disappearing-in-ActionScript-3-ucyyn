This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in ActionScript 3 where trace statements intermittently fail to appear in the output panel.  The issue is not consistent and often related to timing or the application's complexity. The `bug.as` file shows a simple example where the trace statement might not always print, while `bugSolution.as` offers a potential workaround using more robust logging methods.
